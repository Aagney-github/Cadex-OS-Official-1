# Cadex OS
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenCreeck/Cadex-OS-Official.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenCreeck/Cadex-OS-Official)

Cadex OS is a Unix-like based operating system targeting x86 systems. This project is based on the [basekernel](https://github.com/dthain/basekernel) project

Cadex OS is a free and open-source project. You can fork this project and make your own OS from this.
Cadex OS is always Unix-compatible, except that Cadex OS doesn't support VFS (Virtual filesystem) and some Unix libraries are also missing.

Cadex OS can boot an Intel PC-compatible virtual machine in 32-bit protected
mode, with support for VESA framebuffer graphics, ATA hard disks, ATAPI optical
devices, process management, memory protection, small graphics, a standard libc, C++ language support and basic filesystem (DFS).
You can write programs for CadexOS by using the SDK for Windows or cloning the source and adding another application.

## Some useful info about Cadex OS

- Cadex OS supports a small subset of libc, and more functions and libraries from libc need to be implemented.
- Cadex OS has a small BASIC interpreter that can be used to write small programs.
- Cadex OS supports graphical and text-based applications
- Cadex OS uses ELF as the binary format
- Cadex OS supports modules, but it is still in development and is not in the Makefile
- Cadex OS will be useful if you are a beginner in C programming lanhguage and you want to write small programs.
- Cadex OS has a small graphics library called TrueGL. TrueGL is also a UI library
- Cadex OS has many useful string functions defined at `library/string.c`
- Cadex OS uses some code from Musl libc for the libc in Cadex OS. Libraries that are from Musl libc should contain a license header on the top.
- Cadex OS supports C++ apps and thus it has a C++ library. The C++ library is implemented as a header-only library (Note that the C++ library used in this project is completely written from scratch and thus it may not be complaint to the C++ standards)
- Cadex OS is targeted on x86 systems and if you want it to run on ARM-based systems, you will need to rewrite the bootloader and some kernel-side code

This repo was made by HyperCreeck and actively maintained by HyperCreeck and contributors.

## Notable components 

- **kshell**: A small but efficient shell implemented on the kernel space
- **DiM**: A very small text editor
- **pam**: A package manager for Cadex OS (not implemented)
- **cash**: A small bash-like shell implemented on the userspace

## Project structure

- **apps**: Sources for C++ apps
- **arch**: `Makefile.config` for i386 architecture
- **basefs**: Base filesystem folder that goes into the ISO image
- **bin**: System/user commands (`/bin`)
- **docs**: Documentation about used drivers and APIs
- **doxygen**: Config files for Doxygen
- **include**: Header files for C and C++ libraries
- **kernel**: The core kernel source
- **libc**: Source files for libc and libcxx (This includes the standard system libraries)
- **scripts**: Scripts for generating ramfs image and other purposes
- **usr.bin**: User commands (`/usr/bin`)

## Building

First, do the steps mentioned in [docs/Building.md](docs/Building.md).

After you've built Cadex OS, run `make run` and you should see Cadex OS QEMU.

After some initial boot messages, you will see the kshell prompt.
This allows you to take some simple actions before running the first
user-level program. For example, read the boot messages in the qemu serial console to see
which atapi unit the cdrom is mounted on. Then, use the `mount` command
to mount the cdrom filesystem on that unit:

```bash
mount atapi <unit> cdromfs
```

Use the `ls` command to examine the root directory:

```bash
ls /
```

And use the `./` prefix to run a program (For example, a simple screensaver):

```bash
./usr/bin/saver.exe
```

<!-- # Cross-Compiling Instructions

If you are building on any other type of machine (i.e, on WSL or any non-linux machine),
you will probably need to build a cross-compiler
using `./scripts/build-toolchain.sh` and then edit
`Makefile.config` to use the cross compiler binaries,
then execute `make` to create `cadex.iso` -->
